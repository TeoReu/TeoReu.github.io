Hi there! I am Teo, a first year DPhil in Computer Science under the supervised by Proffesor Michael Bronstein. My research area interest in in Geometric Deep Learning, Diffusion Models, and spectral GNNs.

Previosly, I have been studied towards a MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at University of Cambridge, graduating with distinction. While in Cambridge my research focused on Graph Neural Networks (more exactly variational and attentional approaches to graph rewiring under the supervision of [Prof Pietro Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/), [Francesco Di Giovanni](https://francescodgv.github.io/), [Chaitanya Joshi](https://www.chaitjo.com/)) and theoretical remarks for diffusion samplers under the supervision of [Fracisco Vargas](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/fav25).
