Hey! I'm Teo, currently in my first year of DPhil in Computer Science, working under the guidance of [Professor Michael Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/). My research focuses on Geometric Deep Learning, Diffusion Models, and spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

Before this, I did my MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, where I graduated with distinction. During my time there, I dug into the world of Graph Neural Networks, specifically looking into variational and attentional approaches to graph rewiring. I was lucky to work with [Professor Pietro Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/), [Francesco Di Giovanni](https://francescodgv.github.io/), and [Chaitanya Joshi](https://www.chaitjo.com/). I also dabbled in theoretical aspects of diffusion samplers under the guidance of [Francisco Vargas](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/fav25). Looking forward to the exciting journey ahead!
