## About
I am studying Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Manchester. I am passionate about Pure Maths because I love mathematical reasoning and making links between different mathematical fields, such as Number Theory, Group Theory, Graph Theory, Linear Algebra, Analysis, Topology, and so on. In my mind, all of them are representing a very beautiful chain. Applied Maths is also beautiful because seeing actual applications of it in real life gives a sense  tothe work you are putting in while doing maths.


If Mathematics gives me this feeling of an endless field that waits to be explored, Computer Science most definetly reminds me of the infinite dark space filled by scattered stars, planets, etc. My whole life I was fascinated by robots who were able to take decisions, games, web designing... In college, I got involved in many Computer Science related activities. I built with some of my class mates a robot who was able to move, read color and preset images, raise and throw cubes, I interfaced Raspberry Pi with electronic components like sensors and PIRs. Solving problems with algorithms. Developing a 2D platformer with my own costumisation for the pricipal character.
